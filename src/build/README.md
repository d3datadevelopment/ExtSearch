# rebuild assets

All module related CSS/JavaScript files can be found in ``build`` directory. To 
regenerate the modules assets, the ``grunt`` tasks should be used. Please 
install ``grunt`` and run ``grunt's`` default task to regenerate all minimized 
``css`` and ``js`` files:

1. To use `grunt`, `npm` is required. Check ``nodejs`` website for 
   installation instructions (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). 
   Please make sure you have the latest version of `npm` installed. 
   After this, install ``grunt`` globally. 

2. Go to "build" directory and install all related `grunt` plugins:

	```
    npm install
    ```

3. The module-specific LESS/SASS files use the LESS/SASS variables of the shops 
   Flow or Wave theme. 
   
   If the LESS/SASS files of the parent theme are missing, re-install it with Composer 
   and the `--prefer-source` option:

   - delete the desired package in the vendor directory
   - reinstall it with "composer update oxid-esales/*-theme --prefer-source"
   
   If you have customized these, you may need to recreate the 
   module assets. Please note, that CSS and JavaScript files were overwritten by module 
   updates. Then run the generation again or better store your customizations in own files.

4. compile assets from sources (Wave, Flow or Azure theme or its childs)

    Make a full checkout (not an export) of the relevant tag from themes repository at [Github](https://github.com/OXID-eSales/) 
    and copy additional files (especially `build` folder, `Gruntfile.js` and `packages.json`) to 
    Application/views/wave or install theme with prefer-dist option in Composer.

    Now it's possible to regenerate module assets by running Grunts default
    task (`production`) while being in "build" directory:

    ```
    grunt
    ```

    Optionally use one of the following Grunt tasks
    - `grunt production`
    - `grunt development` (generate unminified assets with source maps instead)

5. (optionally) configure "above the fold" stylesheets:

    If you use critical "above the fold" stylesheets, you can generate it by a special Grunt task.  
    Customize the critical-css plugin configuration to your needs in 
    `build/grunt/criticalcss.js`. Change the settings to a valid shop URL and module parameters. Add critical css 
    needs a working shop installation with the latest stylesheets to run.
    
    Use the following Grunt task after executing the basic Grunt task `production` or `development`.
    - `grunt production_critical`
    
    The CSS extractions are created for wave and flow theme. Please note, however, 
    that only the CSS  data can be used, whose theme was active for creation in the shop. If you want 
    to change the shop theme, you need to regenerate the critical CSS with the changed theme.
    
    If the generated above-the-fold style sheets contains formattings, they are 
    automatically included in the shop source.
